# Codename: FrameUI For Firefox
A new way to view your web content, like looking at photos printed from an old Polaroid camera.

# Prerequisites
* For this to work, make sure `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` is set to `true` in `about:config`.
* NOTE: AS OF RIGHT NOW, THIS IS ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH **WINDOWS** AND **LINUX**.  MACOS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AS I DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A MAC AT THIS TIME.
  * Another note: if you're on Linux, make sure your window controls are set to the right side of your title bar.

* To make the most of this theme, it is **STRONGLY recommended** that you install an addon for vertical tabs, such as Tab Center Reborn.  **This is a stopgap for now until I figure out how to integrate native vertical tab functionality into the theme.**

# Installation
Simply drop the provided `userChrome.css` file into your `chrome` folder and restart for the changes to take effect.

# Motivation
After restarting, you'll notice that *all* of the controls -- the navigation bar, the window controls, *everything* -- has been moved to the bottom in a manner reminiscent of the Metro-based Internet Explorer app seen in Windows 8/8.1.  While I think Microsoft was on the right track with their attempts at a tablet-based interface... well, we all know what happened.  And apart from Microsoft, I think no company to this day has yet to get right.

This theme is a step towards what I believe may solve the grand problem of unifying the desktop and tablet interface for ANY device form factor.  What I hope you'll find is that this interface works really well on *both* tablet and desktop form factors, precisely because there is no longer a need for a user to lift their arms to get to something as basic as the window controls.  They're now just a mere finger reach away.

# Reporting Issues
FYI, this project is my first go at using CSS.  As this is the initial release on top of that, I anticipate there will be issues.  If you encounter any bugs or other issues, please post a thread and I'll do what I can, when I can. 

Also: as this theme is a both a thought experiment and work in progress, it is possible the look and feel will change over time.  I welcome any and all suggestions for how this could be improved.  :)
