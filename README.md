# Prerequisites

To make the most of this theme, it is **STRONGLY recommended** that you install an addon for vertical tabs, such as Tab Center Reborn.  

# Installation
Simply drop the provided `userChrome.css` file into your `chrome` folder and restart for the changes to take effect.

# Motivation
After restarting, you'll notice that *all* of the controls -- the navigation bar, the window controls, *everything* -- has been moved to the bottom, reminiscent of the Metro-based Internet Explorer app seen in Windows 8/8.1.  What you'll find is that this interface works really well on *both* tablet and desktop form factors.  And while I think Microsoft was on the right track with their attempt at a tablet-based interface... well, we all know what happened.  And that's why I think no company to this day has yet to get right.

This theme is a step towards what I believe may solve the grand problem of unifying the desktop and tablet interface for ANY device form factor.

#Reporting Issues
FYI, this project is my first go at using CSS.  As this is the initial release on top of that, I anticipate there will be issues.  If you encounter any bugs or other issues, please post a thread and I'll do what I can, when I can. 

Also: as this theme is a both a thought experiment and work in progress, it is possible the look and feel will change over time.  I welcome any and all suggestions for how this could be improved.  :)
